# Build-an-app-for-public-health
My mission here for <strong>Sant√© publique France</strong> is to create an application related to food from the [Open Food Fact dataset](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/).<br>

I want to offer a French application which, when entering the product or product category of your choice, will offer a top 3 of the most recommended brands in terms of nutritional quality.<br>
The app name is : <i><strong>Buy Better</strong></i><br>
<br>
In the first part we cleaned and increased the data of our dataset.<br>
In the second part:
<li>we produced visualizations to better understand the data,</li>
<li>we performed a univariate analysis for each variable of interest to synthesize its behavior,</li>
<li>we confirmed the hypotheses using a multivariate analysis,</li>
<li>we performed the appropriate statistical tests to verify the significance of the results.</li><br><br>
